UrbanEcoTwin-NetZero: Multi-Agent AI-Powered Digital Twin for Net-Zero Sustainability Planning
🧠 1. Project Vision

UrbanEcoTwin-NetZero is an AI-powered sustainability intelligence platform that creates a Digital Twin (virtual replica) of a city and autonomously:

Predicts carbon emissions

Simulates sustainability scenarios

Optimizes carbon reduction strategies

Generates Net-Zero roadmap

Calculates carbon credits

Provides sustainability decision support

🎯 2. Core Problem

Cities currently:

React to pollution after it occurs

Lack predictive tools

Cannot test sustainability strategies safely

Have no intelligent Net-Zero planning system

This project solves that.

🧬 3. Core Innovation

This system combines:

Digital Twin

Artificial Intelligence

Reinforcement Learning

Multi-Agent System

Sustainability Intelligence

into one platform.
